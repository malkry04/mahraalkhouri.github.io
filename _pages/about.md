This piece of news portrays the telegraph in a positive light, as it states how much of an impact the telegraph had in 1861 over the existing mail system and how it brought out significant advancement by offering more certainty and regularity in communication.

These two news pieces discuss romantic relationships formed over telegraph and telephone lines. However, while the first news piece notes a bit of controversy about the mingling of personal affairs with public business at telegraph offices--the second text details the "telephone romance" that led to an engagement and an upcoming wedding. What could be gained when looking at both news pieces is that both illustrate the telegraph and telephone as tools not only for business and communication but also as new mediums for personal connections and romantic relationships in their early days.

**How Was the Telegraph Double-edged?**  
Here are the negative impacts of the telegraph:  
1) Information Overload
- Concerns about superficiality
- Overwhelming volume of information (customers more needy, businessmen always have to be prepared to respond to customers. . .)  

2) Privacy and Surveillance Concerns
- Tracking Native Americans (Sand Creek Massacre, 1864)  

3) Social & Cultural Anxiety
- Women and men allowed to interact in workplaces = Affairs
- Stereotypes (Americans mocked the British)  

4) Hoaxes & Fake News  


As for the positive impacts of the telegraph, they are the following:  
1) Efficiency & Speed   
2) Mass Connecitivy  
3) Emergency Response & Law Reinforcement
- The podcast mentions murderer John Towell's case in 1845, where he attempted to flee on train, but the telegraph was faster. This essentially meant that news traveled faster than the train and by the time Towell had arrived in London, he was arrested.
